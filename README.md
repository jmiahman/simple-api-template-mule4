## Release

Make sure that `pom.xml` file contains the url to your repo (either ssh or http). Make sure to replace it at the following:

```xml
<scm>
  <developerConnection>scm:git:[REPLACE_WITH_REPO_URL]</developerConnection>
  <tag>HEAD</tag>
</scm>
```

In order to prepare a release, execute the following : 

```bash
mvn release:clean release:prepare 
```

You will be prompted to answer a few questions about the release: 

  1) **What is the release version for ...**: the name of the release. should be something like `X.X.X`. Hit enter to accept the default
  2) **What is the SCM release tag or label for ...**: the name of the tag. The default nomenclature is `{project_name}-{version}`. Use the nomenclature `v{version}`, for example `v1.0.5`. Then hit enter.
  3) **What is the new development version for ...**: the development name or the upcoming version you will be working on (the SNAPSHOT version). It should end with `SNAPSHOT`. The pluging automatically increases the patch number. Hit enter. 

You will notice the following temporary files have been created in the root folder : 

  - **release.properties:** contains the release configuration (release tag etc ...)
  - **pom.xml.releaseBackup:** the old content of the `pom.xml` file with the previous release

After you've reviewed the release properties, execute the following to perform the release:

```bash
mvn release:perform 
```
